# Airbnb eslint plugin eslint 9 converter

This simple application converts the airbnb eslint8 rules into an eslint 9 format which can be used in an eslint 9 project.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base
At time of writing there is still no eslint v9 flat config (eslint changed config format), so this repo exists to import this and generate a `airbnb-rules.json` object, until `eslint-config-airbnb-base` has an eslint 9 version.
